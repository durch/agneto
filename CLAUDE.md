# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with Agneto - an agentic development system.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è GOLDEN RULES - READ FIRST
1. **ALWAYS run `npm run build` before making any changes** - TypeScript must compile
2. **NEVER modify files directly** - Use Agneto to make changes to itself
3. **DEBUG=true is your friend** - Use it whenever something seems wrong
4. **Interactive mode is DEFAULT** - The system will ask for your input on plans
5. **Worktrees are isolated** - Changes happen in `.worktrees/<task-id>`, not main branch
6. **Check worktree state before continuing** - Old worktrees may be on outdated master
7. **Rebase worktrees when needed** - `git rebase master` to get latest fixes

## üöÄ Quick Start

### CRITICAL: Before Any Changes
```bash
npm run build  # ALWAYS verify TypeScript compiles first
```

### With the new Makefile (easier!)
```bash
make build     # Build TypeScript
make task ID=fix-1 DESC="fix the bug"  # Start a task
make merge ID=fix-1  # Auto-merge and cleanup (non-interactive!)
make list      # See all worktrees
```

### If you're here to...

**Fix a bug in Agneto:**
```bash
# STEP 1: Verify the build
npm run build

# STEP 2: Test with debug output (auto-generates task ID!)
DEBUG=true npm start -- "describe the fix" --non-interactive

# STEP 3: If empty responses, check provider
DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts
```

**Add a new feature to Agneto:**
```bash
# STEP 1: Start interactive planning (ID auto-generated!)
npm start -- "Add feature X"

# STEP 2: Refine task description if prompted (NEW: Task Refiner!)
# STEP 3: Refine plan when prompted (use 'simplify' if too complex)
# STEP 4: System executes all steps automatically
# STEP 5: SuperReviewer performs final quality check
# STEP 6: Review in worktree before merging
cd .worktrees/task-<generated-id> && git diff master
```

**Debug empty planner responses:**
```bash
# Test in this exact order:
echo "Say OK" | claude -p --permission-mode plan  # Test CLI directly
DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts               # Test provider wrapper
DEBUG=true npm start -- debug-1 "simple task" --non-interactive  # Test full flow
```

**Work on an existing task:**
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Check what's been done first
cd .worktrees/<task-id>
git log --oneline -5
git status
git diff master

# Then continue
npm start -- <task-id> "continue work"
```

## üéØ How Agneto Works (Essential Understanding)

Agneto is a **human-in-the-loop AI development system** with five personas:

1. **Task Refiner** ‚Üí Pre-processes vague task descriptions (interactive mode only)
2. **Planner** ‚Üí Creates structured plans from your task description
3. **Coder** ‚Üí Reads the repo and proposes changes (one file at a time)
4. **Reviewer** ‚Üí Validates proposals against the plan
5. **SuperReviewer** ‚Üí Final quality gate checking acceptance criteria and tests

**Key Concept:** Everything happens in isolated git worktrees (`.worktrees/<task-id>`), so the main branch is never at risk.

### The Flow
```
You describe task ‚Üí Task refinement (optional) ‚Üí Interactive planning ‚Üí Plan approved ‚Üí
For each step: Coder proposes ‚Üí Reviewer checks ‚Üí Apply if approved ‚Üí
All done ‚Üí SuperReviewer final check ‚Üí Review in worktree ‚Üí Merge (auto or manual)
```

### Default Behavior (Important!)
- ‚úÖ **Interactive planning ON** - You refine the plan before execution
- ‚úÖ **Runs ALL steps** - No need to continue manually
- ‚úÖ **Manual merge** - You review before merging to master
- ‚úÖ **Conservative** - Reviewer often asks for human input

## üîß Common Tasks

### Running a Task (Most Common)
```bash
# NEW: No need to specify task ID - auto-generated!
npm start -- "implement user authentication"

# With custom ID (still supported)
npm start -- auth-1 "implement user authentication"

# For CI/automation - skip interactive planning
npm start -- "fix typo in README" --non-interactive

# Auto-merge when complete (use with caution)
npm start -- "update dependencies" --auto-merge
```

### Understanding the Output
```
üìù Planner: Planning "your task"...        # Creating the plan
ü§ñ Coder: Proposing change (attempt 1)...  # Reading code, making proposal
üëÄ Reviewer: ‚úÖ approve - correct implementation  # Reviewing proposal
üôã Orchestrator: ‚úÖ Change applied successfully  # System applying changes
```

### Working with Plans

**Plan gets generated empty?**
- The system prompt might be too complex
- Try simpler task descriptions
- Use DEBUG=true to see what's being sent

**Want to change the plan?**
Interactive mode offers these options:
- **Simplify** - Reduce complexity
- **Add Detail** - Be more specific
- **Wrong Approach** - Suggest alternative
- **Edit Steps** - Modify specific parts
- **Add Constraints** - "Must not break X"
- **Start Over** - New description

### Managing Worktrees
```bash
# See all worktrees
git worktree list

# Review a worktree before merging
cd .worktrees/<task-id>
git log --oneline -5       # Recent commits
git diff master --stat      # Files changed
npm run build              # Verify it compiles

# Merge and auto-cleanup (non-interactive!)
npm run merge-task <task-id>

# Manual cleanup if needed
npm run cleanup-task <task-id>
```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Empty Planner Output
**Symptom:** Plan comes back empty or just a title

**Root Causes & Solutions (in order of likelihood):**

1. **Claude CLI not responding properly**
   ```bash
   # Test CLI directly first
   echo "Say OK" | claude -p --permission-mode plan
   # Should return "OK" - if not, Claude CLI is the issue
   ```

2. **Provider message formatting issue**
   ```bash
   # Test provider wrapper
   DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts
   # Look for "Result 3" - should show a plan
   ```

3. **Task description too complex**
   - Simplify to basic terms
   - Avoid special characters
   - Keep under 100 words

4. **Check actual file content**
   ```bash
   cat .worktrees/<task-id>/.plans/<task-id>/plan.md
   # Sometimes plan exists but display is broken
   ```

### Coder Can't Find Files
**Symptom:** Coder proposes creating files that already exist

**Solution:** Coder only has ReadFile, ListDir, Grep tools. It's working from the worktree directory. Check:
```bash
ls .worktrees/<task-id>/src/  # Is the structure there?
```

### Reviewer Always Rejects
**Symptom:** Reviewer keeps saying "revise" or "needs-human"

**Solutions:**
- Check the plan is specific enough
- Reviewer is conservative by design - this is normal
- After 3 attempts, it stops - review the feedback

### Coder Completion Signals
**Coder can signal completion in two ways:**

1. **Task Complete:** Outputs exactly `COMPLETE` when all plan work is done
2. **No Changes Needed:** Outputs normal proposal but no actual changes applied

**Both are correct behaviors:**
- System handles completion gracefully
- Logs show clear completion status
- SuperReviewer runs final quality check

### Git Worktree Issues
**Symptom:** "fatal: branch already exists" or worktree errors

**Solutions:**
```bash
git worktree prune           # Clean up stale worktrees
git branch -D sandbox/task-1  # Delete branch if needed
rm -rf .worktrees/task-1     # Remove directory
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Reference

### Key Files to Know

| File | Purpose | Modify when... |
|------|---------|----------------|
| `src/orchestrator.ts` | Main control flow | Changing the task flow |
| `src/agents/planner.ts` | Planning logic | Improving plan generation |
| `src/agents/coder.ts` | Code generation | Changing proposal format |
| `src/agents/reviewer.ts` | Review logic | Adjusting approval criteria |
| `src/providers/anthropic.ts` | Claude CLI integration | Fixing LLM communication |
| `src/ui/planning-interface.ts` | Interactive prompts | Changing feedback types |
| `src/prompts/*.md` | Agent instructions | Improving agent behavior |

### Data Formats

**Coder Proposal Format (MUST be exact):**
```
FILE: path/to/file.ts
---8<---
file contents here
---8<---
RATIONALE: One sentence explaining the change
```

**Reviewer Verdicts:**
- `‚úÖ approve` - Apply the change
- `‚úèÔ∏è revise` - Try again with feedback (minor fixes)
- `üî¥ reject` - Fundamental rethink needed (prompts "megathink")
- `üü° needs-human` - Human decision required (approve/retry/skip)

### Provider & Claude CLI

The system uses Claude CLI in headless mode with efficient session management:
- **plan mode**: Read-only for Planner and Task Refiner
- **default mode**: With tools for Coder, Reviewer, and SuperReviewer
  - Coder tools: ReadFile, ListDir, Grep, Bash
  - Reviewer tools: ReadFile, Grep (to verify file state)
  - SuperReviewer tools: ReadFile, Grep, Bash (for tests/build)
- **Session continuity**: Each agent maintains separate sessions using `--resume sessionId`
- **Token efficiency**: System prompts sent only once per session, subsequent calls send just new messages
- Prompts sent via stdin, not as arguments
- No JSON parsing - expects plain text responses
- Tools are Claude's built-in - no custom implementation needed

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Guide

### Adding a New Agent
1. Create `src/agents/newagent.ts`
2. Add prompt in `src/prompts/newagent.md`
3. Integrate in `src/orchestrator.ts`
4. Follow existing patterns from planner/coder/reviewer

### Modifying Agent Behavior
1. Edit the prompt in `src/prompts/<agent>.md`
2. Keep instructions clear and concise
3. Test with `DEBUG=true` to see actual prompts/responses

### Testing Changes
```bash
# Build first
npm run build

# Test with debug output
DEBUG=true npm start -- test-change "test description" --non-interactive

# Test provider directly
DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts
```

### Debug Mode
Set `DEBUG=true` to see:
- Exact prompts being sent
- Raw responses from Claude CLI
- Command construction
- Message formatting

## üí° Design Philosophy

### Why These Choices?

**Git Worktrees Instead of Branches**
- Complete isolation from main codebase
- Can review entire change in separate directory
- No risk of polluting main branch
- Easy cleanup

**Interactive Planning by Default**
- Plans often need refinement
- Human expertise shapes approach
- Prevents wasted execution on bad plans
- Builds trust through transparency

**Conservative Reviewer**
- Better to ask than break things
- Human can always override
- Catches potential issues early
- Maintains code quality

**One File at a Time**
- Easier to review
- Simpler to revert
- Clear git history
- Reduces blast radius

## üìä Current State

### What Works Well
- ‚úÖ Interactive planning with feedback loop
- ‚úÖ Safe sandbox execution
- ‚úÖ Multi-step task completion
- ‚úÖ Clear separation of concerns
- ‚úÖ Good retry mechanism
- ‚úÖ Human interaction for needs-human verdict
- ‚úÖ Reject handling with enhanced feedback
- ‚úÖ Bash tool for testing and verification
- ‚úÖ Squash merge tooling for clean history

### Known Limitations
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Single file changes only
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No parallel task execution
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited to Claude CLI capabilities
- ‚ö†Ô∏è No built-in test suite yet

### Common Gotchas
- Coder works through plan naturally, no forced step ordering
- Coder and Reviewer maintain separate conversation sessions for efficiency
- Reviewer doesn't see actual file contents, just the proposal
- System prompt sent only once per session, subsequent calls use conversation continuity

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

### ‚úÖ Completed (Recently!)
- **Task Refiner** - Pre-processes vague task descriptions
- **SuperReviewer** - Final quality gate after all steps
- **Auto-generated IDs** - No friction, just provide description
- **No-op handling** - Gracefully handles "already implemented" cases
- **Non-interactive merge** - Automatic merge and cleanup
- **Semantic progress tracking** - No more confusing step numbers
- **Semi-stateful sessions** - Efficient token usage with separate Coder/Reviewer sessions
- **Natural plan execution** - Coder works through plan organically
- Human interaction for needs-human verdict
- Reject handling with retry and enhanced feedback
- Bash tool for Coder (testing/verification)
- Squash merge tooling
- Makefile for easier operations
- AI playbook integration in prompts

### Next: Test Suite
- Add comprehensive test suite for Agneto itself
- Integration tests for the full flow
- Unit tests for individual agents

### Future: Phase 3 - Curmudgeon
- Fourth persona to prevent over-engineering
- Reviews plans before execution
- Keeps solutions simple and pragmatic

### Long-term: Enhanced UX
- TUI Interface with three-pane view
- Real-time execution monitoring
- Parallel task execution
- Memory between retries (context passing)

## üéØ Pro Tips (From Experience)

1. **Just provide the description** - IDs are auto-generated now!
2. **Review worktrees before merging** - `cd .worktrees/<id> && git diff master --stat`
3. **Merge is now automatic** - `npm run merge-task <id>` does everything
4. **When in doubt, simplify the plan** - Choose "simplify" in interactive mode
5. **Empty responses = check provider first** - `DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts`
6. **Coder proposals fail? Check the plan specificity** - Vague plans = bad proposals
7. **Always `git diff master` before merging** - See exactly what changed
8. **Break large tasks into multiple small ones** - Better success rate
9. **If reviewer keeps rejecting, the plan needs more detail** - Not a code problem
10. **Rebase old worktrees before continuing** - They may lack critical fixes
11. **Use `make` commands** - Shorter and validated parameters
12. **Claude CLI tools are built-in** - Don't create custom tools, use Bash
13. **Completion signals work well** - Coder says "COMPLETE" when all plan work is done
14. **Sessions are efficient** - System prompts sent only once, saves tokens
15. **Natural execution** - No forced step ordering, Coder works plan organically

### What Actually Works Best
- Task descriptions under 50 words
- Plans with 3-5 concrete steps
- One file change per proposal
- Clear verification criteria in plans
- Using 'simplify' when plan is over 10 steps
- Let Coder work through plan naturally rather than forcing sequence

## üÜò Getting Help

### Quick Diagnosis Checklist
```bash
# Run these in order when something's wrong:
npm run build                     # 1. Does it compile?
echo "OK" | claude -p              # 2. Is Claude CLI working?
DEBUG=true npx tsx test-provider.ts  # 3. Is provider working?
git worktree list                 # 4. Any stuck worktrees?
```

### If All Else Fails
1. **Start fresh**: `rm -rf .worktrees/<task-id> && git branch -D sandbox/<task-id>`
2. **Use simplest possible task**: "Add a comment"
3. **Check the actual prompts**: `cat src/prompts/planner.md`
4. **Verify your changes compile**: `npm run build`

### Remember
- **Conservative is GOOD** - Prevents breaking changes
- **"needs-human" is NORMAL** - Not an error
- **Empty plans mean provider issues** - Not prompt issues
- **Retry mechanism exists** - 3 attempts is intentional
- **Worktrees protect you** - Main branch is always safe
