Classify a Coder response. Output ONLY one keyword: CONTINUE | COMPLETE | IMPLEMENTED.

* CONTINUE: proposing next work ("I'll implement", "I need to", "Next step").
* COMPLETE: all work done ("All done", "Complete", "Finished", "Task complete").
* IMPLEMENTED: changes just made ("I've added/updated/created", "Successfully implemented").

Examples:
"I need to update the user authentication logic in src/auth.ts" → CONTINUE
"All the planned changes have been completed successfully." → COMPLETE
"I've successfully added the new authentication middleware" → IMPLEMENTED
