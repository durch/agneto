Curmudgeon simplification request: # Curmudgeon Review: Gardener Agent Refactor Plan

This plan is **over-engineered and premature** for what you're actually trying to accomplish. You're treating this like a PhD thesis when it's actually a straightforward rename + add pruning logic.

## The Core Problem

You've created 5 "research phases" before doing anything. This is classic analysis paralysis. The task is simple:
1. Rename reflector → gardener (find/replace operation)
2. Add logic to check CLAUDE.md size
3. Add logic to prune old content when too big

That's it. You don't need a multi-phase research expedition.

## Specific Over-complications

**The "Research Required" section is excessive:**
- "Examine current implementation" - Just read the file, it's probably <200 lines
- "Search for all references" - `grep -r reflector` takes 2 seconds
- "Check CLAUDE.md structure" - It's markdown, read it
- "Find existing text manipulation utilities" - Node.js has fs.readFileSync and string.length

**The 5-step research plan before implementation:**
This is procrastination masquerading as thoroughness. You're building a research methodology when you should be writing code.

**"Create Detailed Implementation Plan" as a separate step:**
You're planning to make a plan to make a plan. Just make the changes.

## What This Should Actually Be

**Simple 3-step approach:**

1. **Rename Everything** (15 minutes)
   - Find/replace "reflector" → "gardener" in all files
   - Update imports, function calls, log messages
   - Change prompt file src/prompts/reflector.md → gardener.md
   - Run build, fix any errors

2. **Add Size Monitoring** (20 minutes)
   - Read CLAUDE.md file size before writing
   - If approaching 40k chars, trigger maintenance
   - Simple threshold check: `if (fileSize > 35000) { prune(); }`

3. **Add Pruning Logic** (30 minutes)
   - Parse "Recently Completed" section
   - Keep last 3-5 entries, remove older ones
   - Optional: Consolidate duplicate information
   - Write updated content back to file

**Total implementation time: ~1 hour**

## Why Your Approach Will Fail

1. **Research paralysis** - You'll spend hours documenting instead of doing
2. **Over-abstraction** - You're building a "documentation maintenance system" not solving a specific problem
3. **Premature optimization** - "character counting logic bugs causing data loss" is solving problems you don't have yet
4. **Scope creep** - "Archives or removes old items appropriately" - you're inventing archival systems

## The Reality Check

Ask yourself: Does the current reflector agent work? Yes. Can you find it with grep? Yes. Can you read CLAUDE.md? Yes. Can Node.js count characters? Yes.

Then **just do the work** instead of planning the research to plan the implementation.

## Recommendation

Start over with a simple plan:
1. Grep for "reflector", rename to "gardener"
2. Add size check before writing to CLAUDE.md
3. Add function to remove old "Recently Completed" entries when file too big

No research phases. No multi-step analysis. No "identify existing utilities" - you have `fs` and `string.length`.

**Verdict: simplify**

The core requirement is valid, but you're treating a simple rename+feature-add like a major architectural refactor. Cut the research theater and write the code.
