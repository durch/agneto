# Planning Feedback History

Human feedback (edit-steps): Modify the plan: I like all the steps, conceptually if there is actionable feedback super reviewer should kick off planer and then run the whole pipeline again, ie plan -> code ->  review

Human feedback (edit-steps): Modify the plan: We should definitley not clear work between review cycles, how about we make it simpler, reviewer always escalates to a human, that then has the option to kick off a new cycle, or acceopt existing changes
