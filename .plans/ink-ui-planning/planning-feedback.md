# Planning Feedback History

Curmudgeon simplification request: Looking at this plan, I see several areas of unnecessary complexity that need addressing.

First, the "Research terminal width detection" step is over-engineered. Ink provides `useStdout()` hook that gives you terminal dimensions directly - there's nothing to research here. You're making a simple hook call sound like a research project.

Second, "Design the component structure and data flow" is architecture astronauting. You already have the data sources clearly defined in the requirements - TaskStateMachine provides everything through `getContext()` and `getStatus()`. There's no complex data flow to design here.

The plan also artificially splits what should be a single component implementation across 5 separate steps (3-7). Building a three-panel layout isn't complex enough to warrant this granular breakdown. You're essentially describing "add a Box with text" five different times.

Step 8 "Add visual styling and borders" is listed as a separate step when borders are just props on the Box component. This should be part of the initial implementation, not a separate enhancement phase.

The "comprehensive error handling" step is making a mountain out of a molehill. You just need to check if data exists and show fallback text - this is a couple of ternary operators, not a separate implementation phase.

Here's what this actually needs:

1. Create PlanningLayout component with three Box panels using useStdout() for width calculations
2. Wire up TaskStateMachine data (getContext for task/plan, getStatus for phase)  
3. Add action buttons that call existing getPlanFeedback handlers
4. Test the layout renders correctly

That's it. You're building a display component that shows data from an existing state machine and triggers existing handlers. The current 10-step plan makes this look like you're building a framework when you're really just making a UI component.

**Verdict: simplify**

The core functionality could be implemented in a single file with maybe 150 lines of code. You don't need separate research phases, design phases, and multiple implementation steps for what is essentially boxes with text and buttons.
