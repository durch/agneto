# Planning Feedback History

Curmudgeon simplification request: Looking at this plan, I see several concerning patterns that suggest over-engineering for what should be straightforward tasks.

## Core Issues

**Excessive Research Phase (Step 1):**
The plan treats reading existing code like archaeological research. You're creating a TextInput modal - just look at FullscreenModal.tsx for the border pattern and check if ink-text-input exists in package.json. The grep for "other modal components" is unnecessary exploration that won't inform the implementation. This is one file read and one dependency check, not a research project.

**Over-complicated Verification:**
Every step includes elaborate verification procedures. "Visual inspection shows fullscreen bordered layout (can test with simple test wrapper)" - you don't need a test wrapper to verify this during development. The TypeScript compiler will tell you if it works. Step 8's "Final verification and cleanup" with multiple grep commands is overkill - if it builds, it works.

**Unnecessary Uncertainty Theater:**
The "Uncertainty notes" and extensive risk analysis around ink-text-input's multiline support is overthinking. Install it, try it, see what happens. If it doesn't have multiline, you'll know in 30 seconds. The plan acts like this requires extensive research when the package documentation or a 2-minute test will tell you everything.

**Artificial Step Granularity:**
Steps 3-7 break down "write a modal component" into microscopic substeps (skeleton, layout, input, keyboard, feedback). This is one component - you could write the whole thing, then iterate if something doesn't work. The granularity makes sense for complex distributed systems, not a single React component.

## Specific Simplifications

**Collapse Steps 1, 3-7 into one implementation step:**
```
Create TextInputModal component in src/ui/ink/components/TextInputModal.tsx:
- Copy double-border pattern from FullscreenModal.tsx
- Use ink-text-input with multiline (check docs if unclear)
- Add useInput hook for keyboard shortcuts (Cmd/Ctrl+Enter, Esc)
- Display character count and hints at bottom
- Export as named function

If ink-text-input doesn't support multiline cleanly, try an alternative approach or report back.
```

**Keep Step 2 as-is (type definition):**
This is genuinely separate and straightforward.

**Replace Step 8 with:**
```
Build with npm run build - if it compiles, you're done.
```

## The Real Plan

1. **Add SuperReviewerDecision interface** - Read types.ts, insert interface after line 16, build
2. **Implement TextInputModal** - Write component using FullscreenModal.tsx as reference, handle keyboard shortcuts with useInput, add visual feedback
3. **Verify** - Run `npm run build`

That's it. Three steps. The plan as written treats this like building a framework when you're just writing a modal component.

## Why This Matters

This level of planning overhead creates the illusion of complexity where none exists. You're adding ~200 lines of code total (component + type definition). The current plan makes it feel like building a cathedral when you're hanging a picture frame.

The "research phase" mindset is particularly problematic - it trains developers to treat normal code reading as a special research activity requiring documentation and verification procedures. Just read the file and write the component.

**Verdict: simplify**

The plan needs to collapse the artificial granularity and drop the research theater. This is a straightforward implementation that doesn't need eight steps and extensive risk analysis.

Human feedback: No, we must use proper multi-line handling, do not deviate from the refined requirements by changing the implementation completley
