# Planning Feedback History

Curmudgeon review feedback: This plan looks **appropriately simple and well-structured**. Here's my assessment:

## âœ… What's Good

**Follows existing patterns**: The plan explicitly mirrors the PlanView implementation, which is the right move. Reusing established patterns means less code, less complexity, and consistency.

**Proportional to the problem**: This is fundamentally "copy PlanView, swap content, wire up 'T' key" - and that's exactly what the plan does. Six steps is reasonable for research â†’ create â†’ integrate â†’ test.

**Integration is clear**: The plan shows the complete flow:
- Research existing pattern (step 1)
- Create new component (step 2)
- Add state management (step 3)
- Remove old display (step 4)
- Wire everything together (step 5)
- Validate end-to-end (step 6)

**Pragmatic verification**: Each step has concrete verification criteria. The grep commands in step 1 are specific and actionable.

## ðŸŸ¢ Minor Observations (Not Concerns)

**Step 1 could be lighter**: The research phase is thorough, but you probably don't need all those grep variations. Once you find PlanView, you have your blueprint. Consider: just locate `PlanView.tsx` and read it. Done.

**Steps 3-5 could potentially merge**: Adding state (step 3), wiring the component (step 5), and even removing the old display (step 4) are tightly coupled. You might naturally do these together in practice. However, keeping them separate for clarity in planning is fine - it's not creating unnecessary work, just organizing it.

## Integration Completeness: âœ… Clear

The plan shows:
- **Creation**: New TaskView component (step 2)
- **Connection**: Wired into App.tsx with 'T' hotkey and state (steps 3, 5)
- **Data flow**: Props from `taskStateMachine` â†’ TaskView component
- **Removal**: Old task description display eliminated (step 4)
- **User interaction**: 'T' toggles view, 'Esc' closes it

Nothing is dangling. The feature will actually work when deployed.

## Complexity Check: ðŸŸ¢ Green

- **One new file** (TaskView.tsx) - justified by feature need and pattern consistency
- **No new patterns** - explicitly reusing PlanView approach
- **No abstractions** - direct component implementation
- **Solves stated problem** - nothing extra added

## Final Verdict

**Proceed with implementation.** This is a clean, direct solution that respects existing patterns and delivers exactly what's required. The plan is detailed enough to execute without being over-engineered.

The only minor optimization I'd suggest: You could compress steps 1-5 into fewer discrete phases during actual implementation if the coder finds the boundaries artificial. But as a plan, this structure is clear and communicates intent well.

**No simplification needed. This looks good.**
