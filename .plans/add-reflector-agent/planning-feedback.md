# Planning Feedback History

Curmudgeon simplification request: Looking at this plan, I see several areas of unnecessary complexity and some architectural concerns:

## Over-Engineering Issues

**1. Self-Context Gathering is Adding Complexity**
The plan insists the Reflector "gathers its own context" by reading plan files and audit data from disk. This is inconsistent with how other agents work - they receive context through parameters. You're creating special filesystem coupling just for this agent when you could pass the necessary data directly.

**2. Verification Overhead**
Step 1 ("Verify context availability") involves manual bash commands to check directory structures. This is busywork - either the files exist or they don't. The agent will handle missing files at runtime anyway. This step adds no value.

**3. State Machine Modification May Be Overkill**
You're adding a full state to the state machine for what is essentially a documentation side-effect. The Reflector could run as part of the TASK_FINALIZING state or even as a post-hook after SuperReviewer approval. Adding TASK_REFLECTING, REFLECTION_COMPLETE event, and transition logic is heavyweight for a non-critical, non-blocking documentation task.

**4. Agent Pattern Choice**
Following the "runSuperReviewer pattern" means creating orchestrator helper functions. But SuperReviewer is a critical quality gate - Reflector is optional documentation. These aren't equivalent concerns. A simpler post-processing function might suffice.

## Simplification Recommendations

**Simpler Approach Option A: Hook-Style Integration**
- Skip the state machine changes entirely
- Add a `documentTask()` helper function in orchestrator-helpers.ts
- Call it at the end of TASK_SUPER_REVIEWING case (after approval, before transitioning to FINALIZING)
- Pass it the plan and SuperReviewer results directly - no filesystem reading needed
- Wrap in try/catch so it never blocks
- Result: 2 files changed (orchestrator.ts, orchestrator-helpers.ts) instead of 4

**Simpler Approach Option B: Post-Finalization**
- Run Reflector after task completion (TASK_COMPLETE state)
- No state machine changes at all
- Runs asynchronously without blocking anything
- Can access all task data from audit trail cleanly
- Result: Even simpler integration, truly non-blocking

**If You Keep the Current Approach:**
- Remove Step 1 (verification busywork)
- Combine Steps 2-4 into one step (they're all task-state-machine.ts edits)
- Question whether passing context via parameters is actually simpler than filesystem reads
- Consider whether TASK_REFLECTING needs to exist at all vs running in TASK_FINALIZING

## Core Concern

You're treating documentation generation as equivalent in weight to planning, reviewing, and super-reviewing. It's not. It's a nice-to-have post-process. The architecture should reflect that by keeping it lightweight and decoupled, not by giving it full state machine citizenship.

The current plan adds 4 files and modifies the state machine for what could be accomplished with a simple helper function called in one place. That's the definition of over-engineering.

**Verdict: simplify**

Make this a lightweight post-process hook, not a full state machine state. Pass context directly rather than making the agent read from disk. Combine the state machine edits into one step if you keep that approach. Remove the verification busywork.
