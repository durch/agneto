# Planning Feedback History

Curmudgeon simplification request: Looking at this plan, I see unnecessary complexity creeping in. You're creating a new file and abstraction layer for what should be a straightforward integration.

The plan creates `src/ui/checkpoint-detection.ts` as a separate utility when you could simply add the checkpoint detection logic directly in the CLI's action function. The RecoveryService already provides all the methods you need - `hasCheckpoints()`, `getCheckpointSummary()`, and `getAvailableCheckpoints()`. Why add another layer?

Here's what would be simpler:
1. In the CLI's action function (around line 44 in `src/cli.ts`), directly instantiate RecoveryService
2. Call `hasCheckpoints()` to check if any exist
3. If they do, use the existing prompt utilities to ask the user what to do
4. Pass the decision to `runTask()` 

That's it. Maybe 20-30 lines of code added to one file instead of creating new abstractions and spreading logic across multiple files. You're not building a checkpoint detection framework - you're just checking if checkpoints exist and asking a question.

The current plan feels like "architecture" when you need a "solution". Every new file is a cognitive load, another place to look when debugging, another thing to maintain.

Verdict: simplify
